//=== Upcoming Major Change
//==== Transition from OVAL to VEX Format for Red Hat Security Data

//Prisma Cloud is transitioning from the OVAL format to the new VEX format that Red Hat has introduced and adopted for reporting security data and vulnerabilities in Red Hat artifacts.

//* *Pre-33.00*: Until you upgrade to a 33.xx release, Prisma Cloud will continue using OVAL for vulnerability scanning with no expected impact.
//* *33.xx*: After upgrading your Console and Defenders to version 33.00 or later, Prisma Cloud will switch to the VEX format for vulnerability reporting. This transition might result in a change in the number of reported CVEs due to the inherent differences between the VEX and OVAL content.
//* *Comparison Between OVAL and VEX Formats*: With the OVAL format, Prisma Cloud reports vulnerabilities for each binary found during the scan. However, with the new VEX format, Prisma Cloud will report one vulnerability for the source package and provide information on related binaries.
//+ 
//This means that the number of vulnerabilities with the same CVE ID will be reduced, as Prisma Cloud will report one vulnerability for the RPM package instead of multiple reports for each binary.
//* *Continued Support*: Prisma Cloud will continue to support OVAL format for two major versions—v33.xx and v34.xx—to maintain compatibility with Defenders in pre-33.xx releases, as long as Red Hat continues to produce OVAL files.
//* *Expected Console Loading Time in the 33.xx release*: For new Consoles paired with new Defenders, the Console loading time after a restart event will be approximately 1-2 minutes.
//* *Console Memory Usage in the 33.XX release*: For on-premise users upgrading to the latest Console, the Console memory requirement is 8 GB. This requirement is only for the self-hosted editions.
//
//For a more detailed explanation of this transition, see the link:https://main%2D%2Dprisma-cloud-docs-website%2D%2Dhlxsites.hlx.live/en/compute-edition/assets/pdf/lookahead-transition-to-vex-format.pdf[*Transition from Oval to VEX Files*] document.

//[#enhancements]
//=== Enhancements

// The following enhancements are planned. The details will be available at release:

//[cols="30%a,70%a"]
//|===
//|*Feature*
//|*Description*

// CWP-59339

//|*Enhancement to WAAS Agentless Support*

//|In the upcoming release, WAAS agentless rules will support traffic inspection for AWS Application Load Balancers (ALBs) in addition to AWS EC2 instances. 

//You can view the scan results in the Prisma Cloud console to monitor and manage your ALB traffic inspection. Ensure your AWS account is onboarded to the Prisma Cloud console and then configure the ALB rule. 

//*NOTE*: This feature is enabled on request. Contact your Account team for more information.

//CWP-61282
//|*Lifecycle Support Update*

//|Prisma Cloud guarantees backward compatibility with the last two major releases prior to the current version (N-2).

//Although the support lifecycle remains unchanged, starting from version 33.xx, Prisma Cloud will not restrict the usage of Defender versions or REST API calls with the last three major releases prior to the current version.

//For example, with the current version at 33.xx, API calls and Defenders from version 30.xx will be allowed, while also providing complete backward compatibility support for the 32.xx and 31.xx releases.

//|*Change*
//|*Description*

//CWP-59340

//|*WAAS Agentless - Support AWS LB*

//|The link:https://pan.dev/prisma-cloud/api/cwpp/put-policies-firewall-app-agentless/[Set Agentless App Firewall Policy API] request will have the following changes:

//* The existing `trafficMirroring > vpcConfig` property will be modified to include three new fields:

//** lbARN - ARN of the observed load balancer.
//** lbName - Load balancer name.
//** lbType - Load balancer type.

//+

//*NOTE*: The above-listed fields will be applicable only to ALB load balancers.

//* The following existing fields will be applicable as described below:
//** instanceNames -  used only in EC2 rules.
//** subnetID - used only in EC2 rules.
//** tags - used only in EC2 rules.
//** vpcID - must be left empty ("") for ALB rules
//** autoScalingEnabled - must be true for ALB rules.

//[#addressed-issues]
//=== Addressed Issues

//[cols="30%a,70%a"]


//|The MongoDB package is successfully upgraded to version 6.0.16 in the upcoming release.

//As a result, the console deployed image will no longer be vulnerable to CVE-2024-6375, and will no longer be present on the ignore list.

//CWP-61444

//|*Enhancements in Amazon Linux CVE Reporting*

//|Vulnerability information for many Amazon Linux CVEs lacked consistency across different Intelligence Stream updates, with differences existing in severity levels and fixed status versions.

//The upcoming release includes the following key improvements to address this issue: 

//* Increased consistency in scans
//* Improved handling of duplicate CVEs
//* Accurate conversion of Amazon Linux Security Advisories (ALAS) to CVEs 
//* Refined kernel package rules

//These changes will ensure consistent, reliable, and actionable vulnerability information for all Amazon distributions.


//CWP-58814

//|*Java Versions Standardized to 1.x Format*

//|Inconsistent version numbering for Java products has led to several false positives in Prisma Cloud security scans. 

//To ensure accurate mapping of vulnerabilities to Java versions, all Java product versions will be normalized to the Standard 1.x format. 
//For example, for link:https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-21930[CVE-2023-21930] on the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), OpenJDK 8 will map to Java 1.8.


//CWP-58355
//|*Minor Versions Included for Alpine CVEs*

//|Alpine's security database shows vulnerabilities for each Alpine package, including fixed versions and associated CVEs. 

//However, when a CVE does not include a fixed version, the rule does not report vulnerabilities for minor versions, resulting in incomplete vulnerability coverage.

//This issue will be resolved in the upcoming release. The updated rules will report vulnerabilities for minor versions as well, even when no specific fixed version is available.
