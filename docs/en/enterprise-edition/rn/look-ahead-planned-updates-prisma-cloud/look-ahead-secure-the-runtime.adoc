=== Upcoming Transition from OVAL to VEX Format for Red Hat Security Data

Prisma Cloud is transitioning from the OVAL format to the new VEX format that Red Hat has introduced and adopted for reporting security data and vulnerabilities in Red Hat artifacts.

* *Pre-33.00*: Until you upgrade to a 33.xx release, Prisma Cloud will continue using OVAL for vulnerability scanning with no expected impact.
* *33.xx*: After upgrading your Console and Defenders to version 33.00 or later, Prisma Cloud will switch to the VEX format for vulnerability reporting. This transition might result in a change in the number of reported CVEs due to the inherent differences between the VEX and OVAL content.
* *Comparison Between OVAL and VEX Formats*: With the OVAL format, Prisma Cloud reports vulnerabilities for each binary found during the scan. However, with the new VEX format, Prisma Cloud will report one vulnerability for the source package and provide information on related binaries.
+ 
This means that the number of vulnerabilities with the same CVE ID will be reduced, as Prisma Cloud will report one vulnerability for the RPM package instead of multiple reports for each binary.
* *Continued Support*: Prisma Cloud will continue to support OVAL format for two major versions—v33.xx and v34.xx—to maintain compatibility with Defenders in the pre-33.xx releases, as long as Red Hat continues to produce OVAL files.
* *Console Loading Time in 33.xx release*: For new Consoles paired with new Defenders, the Console loading time after a restart event will be approximately 1-2 minutes.
* *Console Memory Usage in 33.XX release*: For on-premise users upgrading to the latest Console, the Console memory requirement is 8GB. This requirement is only for self-hosted editions.

// |*Enhancement to Photon OS and Amazon Linux OS Feeds*

// |Prisma Cloud now parses Photon OS and Amazon Linux OS feeds using CVE IDs as the primary vulnerability identifier instead of advisory IDs. This change enhances Prisma Cloud’s ability to correlate third-party data, and use vendor-provided information, including backports, severity assessments, and vulnerability scores.
